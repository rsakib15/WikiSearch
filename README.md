# WikiSearch

In this project, we have  to build a search engine for Wikipedia with existing
dumps. Data source is provided here : https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/


We are required to implement searching and ranking algorithms to support the following requirements.

1. Support tolerant(fuzzy) search. Users may wrongly type some
information or process wild-card queries and the system is required to do fuzzy 
search.
2. Support several ranking methods. You need to implement at
least five kinds of ranking algorithms. Note that you are not allowed to use the
existing frameworks such as Lucene.
3. Speed. Given a query, you need to quickly return the ranked
list. You should show the effectiveness and search time of each ranking algorithm
you implement.
4. Provide friendly search system GUI.
